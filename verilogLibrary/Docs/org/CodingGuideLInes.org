  This dosen't work
     initial
     fork
     begin 
     a = 0;
     #5
     end
     join

     #5 cannot be at the end of the block. It should end with ';'. It is pasrt of a statement.

* Differnce between new() and new[]. for user defined classes new() has to be explicitly called for each and every element created by new[].

** Program block

*** Executes in Reactive region

** Assertions

*** Sampeled in Preponded region and evaluated in observed region

** Clocking Block

*** Behaves simimlar to program block and is seen as possible replacemnet to program block.

*** Output is driven possibly in reactive region.

** Coverage
