This directory tree contains the UART block level environment from Verification Academy
Coverage Cookbook

***Please note that the UART RTL is supplied as an example only, it is not intended to be used as
design IP in a real design. Mentor Graphics will not accept any liability if the UART RTL is
used in a design or end product.

The content of the example is as follows:

agents/apb_agent - APB agent used in the UVM testbench
agents/uart_agent - UART agent user in the UVM testbench
agents/modem_agent - UART Modem interface agent, used in the UVM testbench
docs
protocol_monitor - contains an example APB protocol monitor
rtl - Contains the UART RTL source code***
sim - Simulation directory for the example, contains the Makefile
uvm_tb/tb - Top level testbench
uvm_tb/tests
uvm_tb/virtual_sequences
uvm_tb/sequences
uvm_tb/register_model
uvm_tb/env - contains the functional coverage monitors described in the cookbook

To compile and run the example under Questa:

cd sim
make

This will compile the UART RTL and the UVM testbench and then run the following simulations in
batch mode:

word_format_poll - Checks that the UART transmits and receives correctly with no interrupts
modem_poll - Checks the modem interface using polling
word_format_int - Checks that the UART transmits and receives correctly using interrupts
modem_int - Checks the modem interface interrupt operation
baud_rate - Checks the baud rate generator
uart_regs - Checks the UART register accesses

Each simulation will generate a log file and a Questa ucdb file with the code and functional 
coverage results.

To run the tests individually, the make targets are as follows:

make sim_word_format_poll
make sim_word_format_int
make sim_modem_poll
make sim_modem_int
make sim_baud_rate 
make sim_uart_regs

Note that the total coverage attained is not 100%, that is left as an exercise for the reader
