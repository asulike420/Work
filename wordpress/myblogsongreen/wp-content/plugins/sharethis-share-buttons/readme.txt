== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I reconfigured my buttons on the ShareThis platform, but nothing happened on my site. What’s going on here?**

We cache your ShareThis platform button configurations (social networks, button size, labels etc.) to optimize their performance. Sometimes changes you make on the ShareThis platform take a couple minutes to update on your site. Also, if you activate a new button type from the settings page you may experience a similar lag.
